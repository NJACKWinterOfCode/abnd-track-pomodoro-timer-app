## Project Title
**Tamétû - get more done, faster.**

## Project Description
- [Orginal post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/my-collaborative-project-idea/618377)

This Tamétû timer is a simple idea of tricking oneself into working/studying for short intervals for a return of break cycles which consist of a few short breaks and one long break. This results in a focused work session and a lowered tendency of getting distracted.

Central to this technique is a loudly ticking countdown timer and turns out that a physical timer isn't required if one has a smartphone. Tens of thousands (probably more) of people use such apps. Despite this, nothing beats a simple app.
